                    The RenewFit Philosophy
                </h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The introduction of GLP-1 medications has revolutionized weight loss, but it comes with a silent challenge: muscle atrophy. Losing 50 pounds is fantastic, but if 20 pounds of that is muscle, your long-term health, metabolism, and quality of life are compromised. Our mission is to ensure that every pound you lose is quality weight loss, prioritizing the preservation, and refinement of your lean muscle mass. We are not a generic fitness plan; we are your specific defense against muscle loss on medication.

                    The Science of Our Approach
                </h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The RenewFit Protocol is built around maximizing muscle protein synthesis (MPS)—the body’s process of repairing and building muscle tissue. GLP-1 medications suppress appetite, reduce caloric intake, and can unintentionally lower protein consumption, all of which increase the risk of muscle loss. RenewFit counters this by combining targeted resistance training (good form, slow eccentrics, and progressive overload) with protein intake. Compound movements create micro-tears in the muscle, which increases the demand for protein. We encourage members to get sufficient protein intake both pre- and post-workout, while you work one-on-one with a coach to log progression. The program ensures the body has the building blocks and stimulus needed to increase MPS and preserve or even grow lean mass despite reduced appetite. 

                    RenewFit also integrates strategies that specifically mitigate GLP-1 side effects during high-effort training. As intensity rises, so does the risk of nausea, low blood sugar, and dizziness due to delayed gastric emptying. To avoid this, the protocol incorporates the Fed State Mandate (pre-training carbs for stable glucose), and structured rest periods. If dose changes, no problem. Just let us know and we'll work with you to address new concerns. Higher training volume requires reliable recovery, so the program emphasizes sleep, hydration, and strategic fueling, all of which support autonomic stability and prevent the side-effect cascade common when pushing hard on GLP-1 medications. Together, these principles allow participants to train intently, safely, and with predictable progress.

                    The Future of GLP-1 Fitness

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    We believe GLP-1s are a powerful tool, not a magic bullet. True, sustainable success requires a synergistic approach. RenewFit provides the necessary training and nutrition framework to ensure you not only reach your goal weight but also arrive stronger, healthier, and with a robust metabolism ready for the maintenance phase.
